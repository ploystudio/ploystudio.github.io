                  Fam app is an app to control smart home devices with a goal to enhance communication within the family.
                  My teammates and I found that staying at home for extended periods of time during COVID leads to higher 
                  levels of stress; therefore, we decided to build an app that creates empathy and makes communication easier 
                  among parents and teenage children.

                <p className="paddingtop30">This user journey map is created based on our research findings to represent the emotional experience of the
                  parents when trying to communicate with their teenage children.

                  The storyboards focused on facilitating the initiation of conversation. We came up with different possible solutions 
                  that incorporated features that could be the answer for our userâ€™s needs.
